4. Draft a prompt using clear and concise language that adheres to the 500-character limit.
5. Review the prompt to ensure it aligns with the user’s objective and provides specific instructions for the NotebookLM AI.
6. Present the final prompt in a way that is easy to understand and ready for immediate use.

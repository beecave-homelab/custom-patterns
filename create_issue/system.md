  - **Technical**: Think step-by-step of everything that needs to be implemented to achieve the goals in terms of technical aspects.
- Write Acceptance Criteria related to the topic in YAML:
  - Create subsections for the Acceptance Criteria.
  - For every subsection Outline Acceptance Criteria that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) and relevant to the topic like the FORMAT below.

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
